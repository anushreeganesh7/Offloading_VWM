# Offloading_VWM

This repository contains the code and the final thesis report for the project "Effects of Offloading on Visual Working Memory" by Anushree Ganesh (Fall 2022). This project was done as a part of the Bachelor's thesis at Utrecht University. It was supervised by Dr. Christoph Strauch at the AttentionLab at Utrecht University.

## Abstract
An incessant amount of visual information is accrued in our working memory on a day-to-day basis. To maintain the efficiency of cognitive processes, there must be a mechanism by which irrelevant information is dropped or offloaded from the visual working memory. This study aims to understand if items that no longer need storing as they are (again) available externally can be offloaded and if offloading affects visual working memory.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Experiment/`: Contains the code for the experiment. The experiment was created using Python and the PsychoPy library.
- `Data/`: Contains the data collected from the experiment. It contains the raw data preprocessed as DataFrames and converted into .csv files.
- `Analysis/`: Contains the code for the analysis of the data. The analysis was done using Python, Jupyter Notebook and Pandas library. Statistical analysis was done using JASP.
- `Thesis/`: Contains the final thesis report for the project as well as the LaTeX files used to generate the report.
